# WASI_STRATEGY.md — Superseded

> This document described the original design where `tinywasm/wasi` was a runtime
> core and `tinywasm/server` held the adapter (`wasiStrategy`, `wsHub`, `Config` fields).
>
> **That design was replaced.** `tinywasm/wasi` is now a full standalone server.
>
> See [WASI_SERVER.md](WASI_SERVER.md) for the current implementation plan.
